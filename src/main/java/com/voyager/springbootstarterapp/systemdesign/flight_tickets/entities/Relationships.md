Certainly, a data model is essential to represent the structure of your data in a clear and organized manner. Below is a conceptual data model for the flight ticket booking system, designed with relational database tables in mind:
To manage this situation where a flight has multiple legs and a seat can be reused, you'd want to introduce a few additional tables and attributes to your existing data model. Here are the changes:
By extending the data model this way, you can effectively manage the scenario of reusing seats on multi-leg flights.

### Tables

1. **Flights**
    - `flight_id` (Primary Key)
    - `origin`
    - `destination`
    - `total_seats`

2. **Legs**
    - `leg_id` (Primary Key)
    - `flight_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `origin`
    - `destination`
    - `departure_time`
    - `arrival_time`

3. **Tickets**
    - `ticket_id` (Primary Key)
    - `flight_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `leg_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `passenger_name`
    - `seat_number`

4. **SeatAvailability**
    - `seat_id` (Primary Key)
    - `flight_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `seat_number`
    - `leg_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `status` (Available, Booked)
   
5. **Payments**
    - `payment_id` (Primary Key)
    - `ticket_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `status` (Paid, Pending, Failed)
    - `amount`

6. **Notifications**
    - `notification_id` (Primary Key)
    - `ticket_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `type` (Email, SMS)
    - `status` (Sent, Pending)

7. **BookingSagaState**
    - `saga_id` (Primary Key)
    - `status` (Started, Completed, Failed)
    - `ticket_id` (Foreign Key)

### Relationships

1. **Flights <-> Legs: One-to-Many**  
   One flight can have multiple legs (intermediate stops).
   `flight_id` in `Legs` is a foreign key referencing `Flights`.

2. **Flights <-> Tickets: One-to-Many**  
   One flight can have multiple tickets.
   `flight_id` in `Tickets` is a foreign key referencing `Flights`.

3. **Tickets <-> Payments: One-to-One**  
   One ticket can have one payment.
   `ticket_id` in `Payments` is a foreign key referencing `Tickets`.

4. **Tickets <-> Notifications: One-to-One**  
   One ticket can have one notification.
   `ticket_id` in `Notifications` is a foreign key referencing `Tickets`.

5. **Tickets <-> BookingSagaState: One-to-One**  
   One ticket can have one saga state.
   `ticket_id` in `BookingSagaState` is a foreign key referencing `Tickets`.

6. **Legs <-> Tickets: Many-to-One**  
   Multiple tickets may correspond to a single leg of a flight.
   `leg_id` in `Tickets` is a foreign key referencing `Legs`.

In the context of a flight reservation system, the relationships between entities can be designed as follows:

1. **Flight - Leg**: A flight can have multiple legs, so there's a one-to-many relationship between `Flight` and `Leg`.

2. **Ticket - Flight**: A ticket is associated with a particular flight. Hence, there is a many-to-one relationship between `Ticket` and `Flight`.

3. **Ticket - Leg**: A ticket may also be associated with specific legs of a flight, especially in cases where there are intermediate stops. This could be a many-to-many relationship.

4. **Ticket - Payment**: A ticket has exactly one payment associated with it, making it a one-to-one relationship.

5. **Ticket - Notification**: A ticket may have multiple notifications (e.g., booking confirmation, payment confirmation, etc.). Therefore, this is a one-to-many relationship.

6. **Ticket - BookingSagaState**: Each ticket will have one Saga state associated with it if you're using the Saga pattern for distributed transactions. This is a one-to-one relationship.


### Data Model Diagram

You could visualize these tables and relationships in a diagram:

```
Flights ----< Tickets ----> Payments
               |
               |
               +----> Notifications
               |
               +----> BookingSagaState
```

| `Tickets`          | ... (existing attributes)        | One-to-One with `Payments`              |
|                    | - `leg_id` (FK)                  | One-to-One with `Notifications`         |
|                    |                                  | One-to-One with `BookingSagaState`      |
| `SeatAvailability` | - `seat_id` (PK)                 | One-to-Many from `Flights`              |
|                    | - `flight_id` (FK)               | One-to-Many from `Legs`                 |
|                    | - `seat_number`                  |                                         |
|                    | - `leg_id` (FK)                  |                                         |
|                    | - `status`                       |                                         |
| ... (other tables) |                                  |                                         |

This allows you to:

- Track which legs a seat is available for
- Allow different passengers to book the same seat for different legs of a journey
- Easily check seat availability for each leg of the flight
